    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    This is a preview of an app that will be made on top of the electron system, running on chromium.
    Hopefully it gets better with time.
    <p>I know that electron is basically just a run down version of chromium bundled to make standalone web apps,
      meaning wherever chromium can run, electron can too.

    <h2>

      Electro is an application, at first made to learn electron. The actual purpose comes later.
